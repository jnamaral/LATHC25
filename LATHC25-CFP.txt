3rd Languages, Architectures, and Tools for Heterogeneous Computing (LATHC) Workshop

Colocated with the IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization (CGO)

Las Vegas, NV, USA
March 1st, 2025 (Tentative)

The goal of the Languages, Architectures, and Tools for Heterogeneous
Computing (LATHC) Workshop is to gather researchers and developers to
present and discuss recent developments in knowledge and technology
that supports heterogeneous computing systems. This one-day workshop
invites presentation of relevant recent proposals, technology, system
evaluation, design concepts, and other developments that are expected
to have an impact in the performance, usability, availability, design cycle,
power consumption or other aspects of heterogeneous system.

LATHC seeks to feature recent and relevant results, but it does not
require that the content presented be original or unpublished. Thus,
when considering submitting an abstract for a talk, think about your
most relevant recent work. LATHC does not publish proceedings and does
not requires the submission of manuscripts. LATHC expects you to
contribute the slides that you use for your presentation so that they
can be publicly shared in the workshop webpage soon after the
workshop.

The topics covered in the workshop include, but are not limited to,
the following aspects of heterogeneous computing:

* Programming Models and Programming Languages
* Programming Frameworks
* Compiler Design and Implementation
* Intermediate Representations
* Software Stack
* Code Optimization
* Code Generation
* Software Development
* System Architecture
* Processor Architecture
* Accelerator Architecture
* Scheduling
* Computation and Data Distribution
* Energy consumption management
* Performance evaluation
* Benchmarking

Please submit the following to be considered for a presentation at LATHC:

* Presentation Title
* Authors
* Presenting Author
* Abstract
* Brief Biography of Presenting Author
