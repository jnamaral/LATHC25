    <h1>Increasing the scope and resolution of Interprocedural Static Single Assignment</h1>

While intraprocedural Static Single Assignment (SSA) is ubiquitous in
modern compilers, the use of interprocedural SSA, although seemingly a
natural extension, is limited. We find that part of the impediment is due
to the narrow scope of variables handled by previously reported
approaches, leading to limited benefits in optimization.
<p>
In this talk, we present our Interprocedural SSA (ISSA) construction
algorithm where the scope is extended to include record elements and
singleton heap variables. We show that ISSA scales reasonably well (to all
MediaBench and most of the SPEC2K) and demonstrate the effectiveness of
interprocedural copy propagation and interprocedural liveness analysis in
reducing input and output instructions. ISSA is then leveraged for
constant propagation and dead code removal, where 11.8% additional
expressions are folded. Lastly, we discuss future research directions.
