    <h1>Cooperative Memory Management for Multi-core Systems</h1>

While a conventional program uses exactly as much memory as it needs,
the memory use of a garbage-collected program can be adjusted by
changing the size of the heap used by the garbage collector.  This
difference provides challenges and opportunities for both the
application and operating system.  Garbage-collected application can
improve their performance by adapting their memory demands in response
to the changing amount of available memory in today's multicore,
multiprocessor machines.  Because applications' demands are not fixed,
operating systems must also adopt how to best allocate memory between
the concurrently executing processes.
<p>

We first present our adaptive system that allow garbage-collected
applications, working both independently and in conjunction with other
executing applications, to adjust and optimize its memory usage.  As
we show using a series of diverse workloads, this system improves
overall throughput by up to a factor of 4.5 without ever degrading
performance.  We also descibe how operating systems can be modified to
better account for this new application behavior.  By improving how
the OS manages memory for concurrently executing applications, we can
make application performance more predictable and decrease throughput
time.  Taken together, this work shows why memory management must
change in multiprogramming, multi-core environments and how these
changes can be made.
