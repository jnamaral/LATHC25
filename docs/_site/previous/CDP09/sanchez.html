    <h1>Machine Learning Applied to Method-Specific Compilation Strategies</h1>

We describe our ongoing efforts towards developing a machine-learning
approach to customize the code-transformation techniques used by the
IBM Testarossa compiler when compiling each method.
<p>
The main idea is to characterize methods based on a set of features
that can be quickly computed by the compiler before beginning each
method compilation. A training phase explores the space of methods to
be compiled through the application of a large set of combination of
code transformations to methods, and by measuring both the
compilation time and execution time for each method.
<p>

During runtime the features describing a method (e.g.: types of
instructions, presence of loops, etc.) are used to predict which code
transformations are likely to improve the execution time of a method
based on the earlier learning phase.
<p>

The potential for this technique is that it may reduce the total time
spent in a method by a JiT/JVM through the following changes: less
time is spent during compilation because fewer code transformations are
performed when a method is compiled; execution time may be reduced
because transformations that may increase running time are not
performed, and new transformations that may reduce running time may be
performed based on the earlier learning phase.
<p>

Currently we are collecting information for SPECjvm98 benchmarks using
the IBM Testarossa compiler.  Features are stored in compact,
in-memory structures until the end of a measurement stage, at which
point collected data are saved into a binary archive for later use in
the learning stage.
<p>

With these data, we will be able to assess which machine learning
approach (e.g: classification, regression, or clustering) is better
suited for the learning problem, and then evaluate how it performs when
compared to an unmodified IBM Testarossa JIT compiler.
<p>

This research also allow us to evaluate the current compilation
heuristics built based on developers heuristics based on the compiler.
