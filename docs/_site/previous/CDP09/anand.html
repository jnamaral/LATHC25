    <h1>Coconut Case Study</h1>

Coconut (COde CONstructing User Tool) is an experiment in
both programming language and compiler design embedded in the functional
programming language Haskell.  It has been used to both generate C
code and scheduled assembly code for Cell/B.E. SPU libraries,
achieving four-fold improvements in speed over optimized C code using
intrinsic functions.  It is our long-term goal to show that such high-
performance software can be developed in a way which exposes user-
directed optimization in an inherently safe way, which will facilitate
provably correct implementations.
<p>
In this talk, I will use our experience with a complete scientific
application---three-dimensional, nonuniform, iterative Magnetic
Resonance image reconstruction---to discuss the challenges in
developing a declarative programming language which nevertheless
exposes aspects of control flow to the user to enable high levels of
optimization.  In particular, I will explain how we have had to modify
our thinking, to present a more conventional view of the multi-loop
first proposed at CASCON 2007 than the original view which was much
closer to the hypergraph intermediate language used in Coconut, and
how that led to modifications to our scheduling algorithm Explicitly
Staged Software Pipelining.
