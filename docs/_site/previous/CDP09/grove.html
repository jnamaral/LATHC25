    <h1>Compiling X10 2.0 for Scalable High Performance</h1>

X10 is a new language in the PGAS (Partitioned Global Address Space) family,
being as part of the DARPA HPCS program.  In this talk, I will present an
overview of the X10 2.0 language design and implementation, with an emphasis on
how the X10 compiler and runtime system work together to achieve scalable
performance.
