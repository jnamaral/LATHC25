    <h1>Challenges Facing Effective Native Code Compilation in a Modern Just-In-Time Compiler</h1>

The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is under constant pressure from Java
application designers to deliver ever increasing performance
out-of-the-box. Of the major components in the JVM, the Just-In-Time (JIT)
compiler component holds the highest responsibility for performance and
tends to have the greatest influence on a Java application's performance.
The IBM Testarossa JIT compiler faces a number of challenges to delivering
the level of performance expected by our customers, from recognizing and
transforming application features and behaviours that can be effectively
improved to generating high quality code for the exact target processor on
which the application is running, to controlling the use of compilation
resources to most effectively translate Java application code to native
code.  It is this third category that is the main topic of this talk.
<p>

The compilation control subteam of the Testarossa development team was
formed to increase our focus on mitigating the problems facing the
effective use of compilation resources in the many different environments
in which the JIT compiler is employed.  For example, compiling native code
when starting a server faces different challenges than when compiling
native code for server throughput or for a real-time application.
Furthermore, applications themselves vary widely so that effective
compilation for a program with hotspots requires different techniques than
a program with a flat profile. The effectiveness of the JIT compiler can
also be measured in a number of different ways that are of varying
importance to our customers.  Several examples are: how much time is spent
compiling, how long the application is paused while compilation occurs,
how much the throughput performance of the application is improved, how
quickly the performance of the application is improved, how much
performance varies from run to run, etc.  Improving any one of these
metrics generally has a bad effect on at least one of the other metrics,
so appropriately balancing these issues in a dynamic environment
consistently across different platforms to keep our customers happy is one
of the main goals of the compilation controller component in the JIT.  In
this presentation, I will talk in more detail about the set of challenges
facing the compilation controller in a dynamic JIT compiler as well as
give a broad overview of some of the JIT compilation technologies that
have been impacted.
