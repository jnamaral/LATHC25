<h1>Identifying Aliasing Violations in Source Code</h1>

In the process of translating source code to target code, optimizing 
compilers reorder program instructions to improve the runtime performance 
of the generated target code. The amount of instruction reordering an 
optimizing compiler can safely perform is limited by the presence of 
aliasing between memory references. Programming languages have established 
rules, known as alias rules, which describe which memory references may 
alias one another, that is, an aliasing rule specifies whether two memory 
references are allowed to potentially access the same or overlapping 
memory locations. If the program being compiled does not conform to the 
alias rule in effect, the compiler might optimize the program in such a 
way as to modify its intended semantics.
Violations of the alias rules can lead to runtime failures especially when 
the program is compiled at the highest optimization levels, or in time as 
code optimizers evolve to take advantage of previously unexploited code 
specialization or optimization opportunities. To mitigate the problem, the 
program may be recompiled using a less restrictive alias rule. However the 
use of a relaxed alias rule may severely impact the performance 
improvements a compiler can achieve. For this reason, correcting the 
aliasing violations in the program source is preferred, although a 
difficult and time consuming task.
The algorithm we have implemented facilitates the task of identifying the 
aliasing violations in a program. In particular it allows the 
identification and diagnostic of dereferences that potentially violate the 
aliasing rules in effect. Furthermore it allows the compiler to generate a 
report which includes, for each potential violation identified, the 
locations in the source program of the pointer assignments leading to the 
illegal dereference.
