    <h1>Compiler Optimization Framework for Light-Weight Software-Only Checkpointing</h1>

Speculative techniques have generated much interest as multi-core architecture
is becoming increasingly popular.  Any speculative technique needs to
checkpoint programs memory states so that unsuccessful speculations can be
recovered thoroughly and safely. Current bottleneck on checkpointing is the
high software overhead of creating, saving and restoring individual checkpoints
without hardware support.
<p>

In this talk, we present a light-weight software-only checkpointing framework
that heavily leverages on compiler analysis and runtime techniques to
aggressively optimize checkpointing performance.  Programs are instrumented on
source level through either programmer or compiler introduced annotations.
Individual memory location is backed up only if there is a memory write into
it.  Optimizations focus on hoisting backup function calls from within loops
and aggregating multiple backup calls into a single one covering a consecutive
memory range, so that i) the number of backup calls is minimized and ii) the
amount of to-be-copied memory is minimized. Finally, each memory backup
operation is optimized from a function call into one or a few memory copy
instructions, with only necessary bookkeeping structures for recovery.
