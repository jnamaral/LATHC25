Abstract: 

Thread-level Speculation (TLS) is a technique for automatic
parallelization that has shown excellent results in hardware
simulation studies.  Existing studies, however, typically require a
full stack of analyses, hardware components, and performance
assumptions in order to demonstrate and measure speedup, limiting the
ability to vary fundamental choices and making basic design
comparisons difficult.  Here we approach the problem analytically,
abstracting several variations on a general form of TLS (method-level
speculation) and using our abstraction to model the performance of TLS
on common coding idioms.  Our investigation is based on exhaustive
exploration, and we are able to show how optimal performance is
strongly limited by program structure and core choices in speculation
design, irrespective of data dependencies.  These results provide new,
high-level insight into where and how thread-level speculation can and
should be applied in order to produce practical speedup.
