Abstract:

Locality analysis traditionally focuses on data reuse patterns, in
particular, the reuse distance of each access.  At fine granularity
such as cache blocks, the full analysis causes hundreds to thousands
of times slowdown.  Sampling, a common statistical tool, cannot reduce
the cost by simply lowering the sampling rate, because it may still
have to examine the whole trace to identify the next use of a sampled
datum.

An alternative locality model is footprint, the amount of data
accessed in an execution window.  Recent advances have made it
possible to measure all-window footprints.  In this talk, we show the
relation between the new footprint statistics and the traditional
locality statistics.  By connecting the two, we reduce the cost of
off-line modeling of cache sharing by over 200 times and enable
on-line locality analysis through parallel sampling at a marginal
cost.  The results show empirically, with overwhelming evidence, a
simple relation between all-window statistics and reuse-window
statistics.
