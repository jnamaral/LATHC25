<h3>From Speculative Partial Redundancy Elimination to Speculative Partial Dead Code Elimination</h3>
<h4>R. Nigel Horspool, David Pereira - University of Victoria</h4>
  
Although SPRE can be mapped to a network flow problem and 
solved optimally, there are some practical issues which
still must be addressed.  Perhaps the most important is
keeping register pressure under control, while another would  
be extending SPRE to work with unsafe expressions.  We discuss
some ideas for adapting SPRE and also some very early ideas
for developing a speculative version of partial dead code 
elimination (SPDE).
