<h3>abc - The AspectBench Compiler</h3>
<h4> Laurie Hendren - McGill University</h4>

<p>The Sable research group from McGill University and the Programming
  Tools Group from Oxford University have recently developed abc, a
  research framework for the AspectJ programming language.  The abc
  compiler is publicly-avaliable under the GNU LGPL license.  The
  toolkit has been designed with research in mind, for both
  experimentation with new aspect-oriented language features and
  research into optimizations for aspect-oriented languages.  

<p>This
  talk will introduce AspectJ language, present the highlights of the
  abc compiler framework, and discuss some preliminary experimental
  data comparing the performance of the existing ajc compiler with the
  abc compiler.
