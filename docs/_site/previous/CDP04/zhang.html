<h3>Experiments with auto-parallelizing SPEC2000FP benchmarks</h3>
<h4>Guansong Zhang, Priya Unnikrishnan, and James Ren - IBM Toronto Lab</h4>

We document the experimental work in our attempts to automatically
parallelize SPEC2000FP benchmarks for SMP machines. This is not purely
a research project. It was implemented within IBM's software
laboratory in a commercial compiler infrastructure which implements
OpenMP 2.0 specifications in both Fortran and C/C++. From the
beginning, our emphasis is on using simple parallelization
techniques. We aim to maintain a good trade off between performance,
especially scalability of an application program and its compilation
time. Although the parallelization results show relatively low speed
up, it is still promising considering the problems associated with
explicit parallel programming and the fact that more and more
multi-thread and multi-core chips will soon be available even for home
computing.
