<h3>Profile-Guided Switch Statement Case Dispatching</h3>
<h4>Peng Zhao - University of Alberta</h4>

In a number of important appliations, such as parsers and
interpreters, large switch case statements are executed often. In such
applications, it is important to implement efficient case dispatching
to improve the performance of such statements. Through profiling we
discovered that sometimes the default action of a switch case
statement is selected often in some applications. Thus we developed a
technique called Default Case Promotion (DP) which accelerates
dispatches in this situation. We also use feedback information to
develop a Switch Case Partitioning (SP) technique that enables
improved inlining. In this talk we describe the implementation of
these two techniques in the Open Research Compiler (ORC) and present
results from an extensive experimental performance study that includes
all the known techniques for case dispatching in switch case
statements.
