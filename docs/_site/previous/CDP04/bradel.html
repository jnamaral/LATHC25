<h3>The use of traces for inlining in Java programs</h3>
<h4>Borys Bradel and Tarek Abderlrahman - Univ. of Toronto</h4>

In this talk we will describe our recent work on evaluating  
the effectiveness of the use of traces for inlining in Java programs.  
We built a trace collections system for the Jikes Research Virtual  
Machine to create traces based on the execution of the SPECjvm98 and
Java Grande benchmarks. We find that traces lead to a 10% decrease  
in execution time compared to providing information from Jike's  
adaptive system, in spite of a code expansion of 47%. This performance 
is also slightly better that what is achieved when using a greedy
algorithm.
