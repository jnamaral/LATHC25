<h3>A Method of Interprocedural Strength Reduction</h3>
<h4>Shimin Cui - IBM Toronto Lab</h4>

Strength reduction is a well known technique for optimizing code by 
reformulating certain costly computations in terms of less expensive ones.
We will discuss an interprocedural compilation method for reducing the 
costly computations in strength interprocedurally to improve the 
performance in the execution of the compiled code. Based on the cost
analysis, a global variable is generated to maintain the value of the  
computations. The global variable is updated every time when the 
computations may change, while the costly computation in the loop is
replaced by a cheap computation, such as the load of the global variable. 
We will also discuss the extension of the method to improve the data cache
performance in addition to the strength reduction interprocedurally.
