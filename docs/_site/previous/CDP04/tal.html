<h3>Second-Order Predictive Commoning</h3>
<h4>Arie Tal - IBM Toronto Lab</h4>

Many compiler optimization technologies are designed towards reducing                             
memory access latency in application software. Memory access latency is                           
most apparent in loops - iterating program code - that read from or write                         
to a large number of memory addresses (cells). Due to the slow access to                          
memory, the processor is usually forced to stall until the required data is                       
retrieved from memory.                                                                            
                                                                                                  
Second-Order Predictive Commoning is the identification of sub-expressions                        
and combinable sub-expressions - expressions that can be combined together                        
(possibly through re-association) to form a sub-expression. such that the                         
results of their computation can be reused in immediately subsequent                              
iterations. Then, instead of just reducing the number of memory accesses,                         
we may save computations such as multiplications, additions, function                             
calls. Second-Order Predictive Commoning as described here was designed to                        
handle very general forms of indexed expressions including calls to                               
functions with parameters that are expressions based on the loop induction                        
variable., etc.                                                                                   
                                                                                                  
Three dimensional stencil codes contain opportunities for Second-Order                            
Predictive Commoning to save computations of combinable sub-expressions.                          
These sub-expressions carry the combined sum of certain memory elements                           
over to the following iterations. For example, the subroutine "psinv" in                          
mgrid (from the SPEC2000 benchmark) contains such an opportunity. Similar                         
opportunities exist in subroutine "resid" in the same benchmark, tomcatv                          
benchmark from spec92 and others.
