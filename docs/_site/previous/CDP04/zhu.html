<h3>Taming Pointers -- A Symbolic Approach</h3>
<h4>Jianwen Zhu - University of Toronto</h4>
                                                                                                  
Parallelizing compilers often stumble on the pointer analysis     
problem, or the computation of runtime pointer values at  
compile time. The challenges of precise pointer   
analysis stem from the need to explore an exponential number of   
program execution paths, and the need to maintain program state   
for every program point under all such paths.     
  
In this talk, I will introduce a new method for constructing      
scalable graph algorithms (ICCAD'02, PLDI'04), called     
superposition, which solves different problem instances in an     
aggregate fashion. Applying this method to pointer analysis,      
different program states under different execution paths are      
combined into a single Boolean function, and solved together using
the efficient, BDD-based image computation operator developed by  
the formal verification community. Experimental results show that 
context-sensitive, flow-insensitive analysis on programs with     
billions of different calling paths can be analyzed in seconds.   
  
The subject of this talk can be of interest to researchers in     
high-performance compiler, software engineering and software security.
