So, what is wrong with C11/C++11? What is still missing from OpenMP? What
problems are there in integrating Transactional Memory with legacy code? I
argue that all these standards are trying to do similar things. They all
are trying to cover weak points in their specification or their base
language, by trying to take us to a future direction that is clearly
missing in today's standards. This talk will be about what is missing in
today's base languages that makes them nothing more then beautiful
scripting languages, unless we do something.
