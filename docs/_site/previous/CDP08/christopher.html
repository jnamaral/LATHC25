    <h1>Sampling-based Whole Program Locality Profiling</h1>

The widening gap between processor speed and memory access time causes data
locality to have an ever increasing impact on overall program
performance. Improving locality primarily consists of augmenting memory layout
and data access patterns. Unfortunately, improving just one of these may
actually hurt the other. Thus, the two should be improved concurrently to
maximize performance efforts.
<p>

Suggestions for Locality Optimizations Rochester (SloR) is a locality analysis
tool that collects samples of accesses at run time and provides the programmer
suggestions to improve both the spatial and temporal locality.  SloR is an
extension of Slo, a tool originally developed by Kristof Beyls at the
University of Ghent. Slo samples individual memory access reuses and provides
suggestions to move reuses closer together. With only temporal locality
information, it was able to halve execution times of several SPEC2000
programs. Nonetheless, Slo is only concerned with temporal locality of data
elements.
<p>

SloR preserves all the functionality of Slo and also provides a number of
additional features. First, it provides feedback on so-called block
sampling. Directly analyzing specific memory accesses leads to a false sense of
understanding because cache blocks contain more than a single piece of
data. Block sampling originates from this idea. In addition to analyzing
specific memory elements, SloR also examines the temporal locality of memory
blocks. SloR also provides a spatial locality ranking. It identifies the causes
of poor spatial and temporal locality with the precision at least as fine as a
single basic block. Finally, SloR provides feedback on the layout of fields
within structures based on reference affinity. While full reuse distance would
cause a slowdown by a factor in the hundreds, sampling based analysis is
typically within a factor of ten of the original execution.
