    <h1>Advancement of the Auto-SIMDization Technology in the XL Compiler</h1>

The Auto-SIMDization technology is constantly expanded to handle more
challenging loops present in applications.  As a common SIMD framework is
leveraged across different platforms including BGL/P/Q, VSX/VMX, SPU,
enhancements to one platform often directly benefit others.  In this talk, a
myriad of novel SIMD techniques implemented in the XL compiler in the past year
will be presented.  The techniques include SIMDization of non-stride-one memory
access via SLP, identifying minimum and maximum locations in a SIMD loop, and
SIMD for parallel loops.  Loop kernels fr om real applications will be used to
illustrate the techniques along with performance improvements.  This talk will
conclude with ideas for furthering the SIMD technology in the future.
