    <h1>Automatic Trace-Based Parallelization of Recursive Programs</h1>

We explore the use of traces, i.e. hot paths of execution, as units of parallel
work.  This approach has many advantages, including not requiring source code,
subsuming loops and methods as units of parallel work, and allowing for
efficient collection of runtime information.  In previous work, we have
demonstrated these benefits and addressed the challenges of using traces for
data-parallel applications in an offline feedback directed system.  In this
talk, we will describe the progress made towards automatically parallelizing
recursive applications.  In particular, we will present the execution model
that we use, describe how applications are transformed, and show some
preliminary results.
