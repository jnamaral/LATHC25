    <h1>Compiler Exploitation of Decimal Floating-Point Hardware</h1>

Decimal Floating Point (DFP) is an alternative to the popular Binary
Floating Point (BFP) representation for decimal numbers.  With DFP
representation, numbers are stored in decimal digits, allowing
applications, such as calculators, to achieve the high level of accuracy.
Traditionally, DFP arithmetic is supported by computationally expensive
software libraries.  To overcome this performance bottleneck, IBM
introduced dedicated hardware DFP co-processors for the z10 and POWER6
processors which eliminate the need for DFP software libraries.  This
presentation will focus on the DFP representation and applications as well
as the latest development on how the IBM C/C++ compiler and Java SDK6 are
taking advantage of the new hardware DFP co-processors.
