    <h1>Dataflow Analysis of Computer Game Narratives</h1>

Many modern computer games tend to provide large, complex narratives, ensuring
both extended and interesting game play. Unfortunately, game narratives often
contain defects, represented by unwinnable situations, unspecified outcomes,
and so forth, reducing the quality of games, and in the worst case leading to
unexpected program behaviour or crashes.  We present an approach to formally
verifying the correctness of a game narrative based on program analysis
techniques.  Dataflow analysis is applied to a precise narrative specification,
and used to optimize a search of the complete game state space.  By focusing on
a "high-level" narrative model we are able to add several further analyses that
provide additional semantic information, reducing the verification costs and
resulting in an analysis system that can examine non-trivial narratives in
relatively little time---an improvement of several orders of magnitude over the
state-of-the-art. This work demonstrates a practical and effective design for
improving computer games, as well as an interesting adaptation of program
analysis techniques to game analysis.
