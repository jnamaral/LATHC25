    <h1>AOT Compilation In a Dynamic Environment for Startup Time Improvement</h1>

The Java language has been popular for its many characteristics including
object-oriented nature, security, and portability.  However, it's
performance compared to static languages has been a concern.  Numerous
efforts have been focused on trying to mitigate the performance
differences.  One of those technologies is the JIT compiler, which has
been found to achieve better performance than static compilers for a
number of benchmarks.  However, the JIT compiler is a double-edged sword.
Although JIT compilation can help improve throughput performance of
applications, the dynamic nature of JIT compilation increases the overhead
during runtime and reduces the efficiency when fast response time is
needed or when applications are starting up.
<p>

The AOT compiler acts as a good substitute that can achieve better startup
performance and at the same time, performs better than interpretation.
Moreover, by combining the AOT technology with JIT technology and allowing
AOT methods that are executed frequently to be recompiled by the JIT
compiler, high throughput performance can be achieved along with fast
startup time.  The AOT compiler in the IBM JRE for Java 6 supports this
functionality and has been released on all 18 of IBM's J2SE platforms. The
AOT compiler compiles methods into AOT code while the application is run
for the first time and stores the code into a persistent cache.  The
previously compiled AOT code can be loaded by subsequent JVMs for fast
startup and response time.  We have made a number of improvements to the
AOT technology, for example, better detection of the startup phase and
allowing the methods to be recompiled earlier, for improving startup and
throughput respectively.  Our experimental results have shown significant
startup improvements by using AOT compilation: up to 18% for Websphere
Application Server and 10% for Rational Application Developer.
<p>

This presentation will provide an overview of the AOT compiler in the IBM
JRE for Java 6, explain the recent enhancements we have made to better
exploit the AOT technology for faster startup time with good throughput,
and summarize some cross-platform experimental results which demonstrate
the effectiveness of the AOT compiler to help improve startup performance.
