    <h1>Efficient Locality Approximation Using Time</h1>

Locality, characterized by data reuses, determines caching
performance. Reuse distance (i.e. LRU stack distance) precisely
characterizes program locality and has been used in memory-related
research since 1970s. However, the high cost of measuring it still
urges a breakthrough before its practical uses in performance
debugging, locality analysis and optimizations of long-running
applications.
<p>

In this work, we improve the efficiency by exploring the connection
between time and locality. We propose a statistical model converting
cheap time distance to costly reuse distance.  Compared to the
state-of-the-art technique, this approach reduces measuring time by 17
times, and approximates cache line reuses with over 99%
accuracy. Experiments demonstrate the effective uses of the
approximated reuse distance in cache miss rate prediction. This work,
for the first time, reveals the strong correlations between time and
locality. It makes precise locality as easy to obtain as data access
frequency, removes the obstacles to reuse distance's practical uses,
and opens new opportunities for program optimizations.
