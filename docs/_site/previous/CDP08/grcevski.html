    <h1>Buffered dynamic run-time profiling of arbitrary data for Virtual
Machines which employ interpreter and Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler</h1>

Run-time program profiling information can be very important for helping a
compiler understand the dynamic program behavior and thereby allowing more
targeted and aggressive optimization of the program. In a Virtual Machine
(VM) environment with dynamic compilation, most of the profiling is
performed on-line, while the application is running. One of the biggest
challenges faced by VM designers when designing profiling frameworks is to
efficiently collect and use the profiling data so that the application
performance isn't affected significantly. For example, if the VM took a
long time to collect the profiling information, or if it took a long time
to process the collected data, the initial start-up performance of the
application would be severely degraded. Another important aspect of the
data collection process is the memory footprint overhead; the data
collected by the profiler could take up a significant amount of memory. On
the other hand, having more profiling information and more precise
information is the key to better code and better run-time execution
performance.
<p>

This presentation describes a buffered approach to collecting arbitrary
profiling data about the program execution (using the VM's interpreter
component) that is low overhead and memory efficient. Our approach
maintains loose coupling between the interpreter and the JIT compiler,
separating the responsibility of each component. The interpreter collects
the data but the JIT compiler maintains and uses the buffered information
periodically or on demand. We'll also discuss some of the algorithms we use
to throttle the data collection to minimize the profiling impact on the
application startup performance, while still collecting high quality
profiling information about the application execution.
