	<p>Languages, Architectures, and Tools for Heterogeneous Computing (LATHC) Workshop</p>

	<p>Colocated with the IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization (CGO)</p>

	<p>The goal of the Languages, Architectures, and Tools for Heterogeneous
Computing (LATHC) Workshop is to gather researchers and developers to
present and discuss recent developments in knowledge and technology
that supports heterogeneous computing systems. This one-day workshop
invites presentations discussing relevant recent proposals, technology, system
evaluation, design concepts, and other developments that are expected
to have an impact in the performance, usability, availability, design cycle,
power consumption or other aspects of heterogeneous system.</p>

<p>LATHC seeks to feature recent and relevant results, but it does not
require that the content presented be original or unpublished. Thus,
when considering submitting an abstract for a talk, select your
most relevant recent work. LATHC does not publish proceedings and does
not require the submission of manuscripts. LATHC expects you to
contribute the slides that you use for your presentation so that they
can be publicly shared in the workshop webpage soon after the
workshop.</p>

<p>The topics covered in the workshop include, but are not limited to,
the following aspects of heterogeneous computing:
<ul>
  <li> Programming Models and Programming Languages </li>
  <li> Programming Frameworks </li>
  <li> Compiler Design and Implementation </li>
  <li> Intermediate Representations </li>
  <li> Software Stack </li>
  <li> Code Optimization </li>
  <li> Code Generation </li>
  <li> Software Development </li>
  <li> System Architecture </li>
  <li> Processor Architecture </li>
  <li> Accelerator Architecture </li>
  <li> Scheduling </li>
  <li> Computation and Data Distribution </li>
  <li> Energy consumption management </li>
  <li> Performance evaluation </li>
  <li> Benchmarking </li>
</ul>
  </p>

	<p>Please submit the following to be considered for a presentation at LATHC:
<ul>
  <li> Presentation Title </li>
  <li> Authors </li>
  <li> Presenting Author </li>
  <li> Abstract </li>
  <li> Brief Biography of Presenting Author </li>
</ul>
</p>

	<p>LATHC does not publish proceedings. Presenters are required
	to provide an electronic copy of their slides. The slides will
	be available on this website soon after the workshop. Work
	presented does not need to be original: work that has been
	recently published or submitted for publication elsewhere is
	welcome.</p>
